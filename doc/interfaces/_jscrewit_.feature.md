# Interface: Feature

Objects of this type indicate which of the capabilities that JScrewIt can use to minimize the
length of its output are available in a particular JavaScript engine.

JScrewIt comes with a set of predefined feature objects exposed as property values of
`JScrewIt.Feature` or <code>[JScrewIt.Feature.ALL](_jscrewit_.featureconstructor.md#all)</code>, where the property name is
the feature's name or an alias thereof.

Besides these predefined features, it is possible to construct custom features from the union
or intersection of other features.

Among the predefined features, there are some special ones called *elementary* features.
Elementary features either cannot be expressed as a union of any number of other features, or
they are different from such a union in that they exclude some other feature not excluded by
their elementary components.
All other features, called *composite* features, can be constructed as a union of zero or
more elementary features.
Two of the predefined composite features are particularly important: <code>[DEFAULT](_jscrewit_.featureall.md#default)</code>
is the empty feature, indicating that no elementary feature is available at all;
<code>[AUTO](_jscrewit_.featureall.md#auto)</code> is the union of all elementary features available in the current
engine.

Not all features can be available at the same time: some features are necessarily
incompatible, meaning that they mutually exclude each other, and thus their union cannot be
constructed.

###  restrict

▸ **restrict**(`environment`: "forced-strict-mode" | "web-worker", `engineFeatureObjs?`: keyof PredefinedFeature[]): *[CustomFeature](_jscrewit_.customfeature.md)*

*Defined in [feature.d.ts:128](https://github.com/fasttime/JScrewIt/blob/2.11.0/lib/feature.d.ts#L128)*

Creates a new feature object from this feature by removing elementary features that are
not available inside a particular environment.

This method is useful to selectively exclude features that are not available inside a web
worker.

**Parameters:**

Name | Type | Description |
------ | ------ | ------ |
`environment` | "forced-strict-mode" &#124; "web-worker" |   The environment to which this feature should be restricted. Two environments are currently supported.  <dl>  <dt><code>"forced-strict-mode"</code></dt> <dd> Removes features that are not available in environments that require strict mode code. </dd>  <dt><code>"web-worker"</code></dt> <dd>Removes features that are not available inside web workers.</dd>  </dl>  |
`engineFeatureObjs?` | keyof PredefinedFeature[] |   An array of predefined feature objects, each corresponding to a particular engine in which the restriction should be enacted. If this parameter is omitted, the restriction is enacted in all engines.  |

**Returns:** *[CustomFeature](_jscrewit_.customfeature.md)*
